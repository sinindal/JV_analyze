Solar-cell-data-analysis
========================

Solar cell data analysis using python modules pandas, matplotlib and pyqt

With this program you can perform analysis of production data of (silicon) solar cells. It provides a graphical user interface.

<b>Features</b>

- Unlimited number of large data sets (e.g. 100k cells takes a few seconds)
- Automatic data filtering, including the possibility of filtering data sets with different settings in one session
- Automatic rendering of an Excel report containing summary and yield loss information
- A selection of different graphs (the number of data sets is unlimited, but there are only 8 different colors)
- All the graphs are interactive: You can select the data sets to show, set the scale, axis labels etcetera
- Cross-platform - mainly tested on Windows; partially tested on linux; should also be compatible with Mac OS
- Multiple language support (work in progress)

Install

To install you can choose between two methods:
- download the source code and use it in combination with a python distribution installation (e.g. Python(x,y), Anaconda, Enthought on Windows)
- download the release file and run it direcly after unzipping (Windows only)

Using the program

Many of the features will be self-explanatory to solar cell engineers. To help you get started there are three CSV data files that you can load and process with the program. The CSV files also show what format your data has to be in, in order for the program to process the data.
